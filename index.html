    <h2>Data Collection and Training</h2>
    <p>We collected historic data from the league table using <a href="https://understat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understat</a> and its <a href="https://understat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API</a> from 2017 to 2022 for each team, one day before each individual match. This data was then correlated with historic results and odds gathered through <a href="https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Football-Data.co.uk</a>. A linear regression algorithm was trained to predict Home Goals and Away Goals.</p>
